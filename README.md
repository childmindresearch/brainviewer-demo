# [BrainViewer Demo](https://childmindresearch.github.io/brainviewer-demo/)

This is an audio-visual demo of the BrainViewer library originally written at the [OHBM Brainhack 2023](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2023/). It allows you to view a brain surface and interact with it.

The brain responds to the users microphone input. Zoom is influenced by the low frequency content of the audio, and rotation is influenced by the high frequency content.
